# A Guide To Prepare for the Gremlin Enterprise Chaos Engineering Certification Exam 

Update: In 2023, we combined our Gremlin Certified Chaos Engineering Practitioner (GCCEP) and Gremlin Certified Chaos Engineering Professional (GCCEPro) certifications into a single new certification, the Gremlin Enterprise Chaos Engineering Certification (GECEC). Everything you need to prepare for this new certification is available in the course itself. To access it, sign up for free at [gremlin.com/certification](https://www.gremlin.com/certification/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=content-text).

The study guide for the original courses is [still available here for reference](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/gremlin-certified-chaos-engineering-practitioner-exam-preparation-guide/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=content-text), but please keep in mind some of this information may no longer be relevant as you take the GECEC.

We wish you the best of luck preparing for your exam!

Reliably Yours,
